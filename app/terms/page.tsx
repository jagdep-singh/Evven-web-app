              <p>
                Evven is a shared expense tracking tool. It helps groups of
                people — roommates, travel companions, teams, and organizations
                — log costs, calculate fair splits, and track who paid what.

                Evven does not process payments, hold funds, or act as a
                financial institution. It is a record-keeping and calculation
                tool only. Settling up between members happens outside of
                Evven, through whatever payment method your group chooses.
